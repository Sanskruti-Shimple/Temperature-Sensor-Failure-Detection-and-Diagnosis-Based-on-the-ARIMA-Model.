 <h1><b>Summary<b/><h1/>
<h6>
Predicted the future values of temperature of the temperature sensors and predict which type of fault has happened in the sensor. To Predict the values, I have used the ARIMA model.

Common terms to start with this project are as follows:

What is Time series?
Time series is a set of observations on the values that a variable takes at different times. eg. Sales trends, stock market prices, and weather forecasts.
Trend: The data values which increase or decrease.
Seasonality: The data changes according to the season.
White Noise: The data which is totally random in nature.
We can do time series forecasting only on trend data and seasonal & not on sine data and complete random data.
AR Model: In this model the next value is predicted using the previous value multiplied by some values and adding the constant term to it. MA Model: In this model, the next value is predicted using the error that is generated by two consecutive terms. ARMA Model: This model is simply the combination of the above two models.

ARIMA(Autoregressive Integrated Moving average model: This is the model on which we are mainly focussing on In this model, there are three parameters.

P values: P value is how many previous values you are using to predict future values. for eg., if 9 am temperature data is predicted using the 8 am data then you are using only one hour gap so here p value become 1.

D value : D is how many times you are using the differencing method to make your data stationary. here differencing means shifting the values by 1-1 and then taking the difference between the values that are in columns and then the new series will form that difference series and that will make our data stationary.

Autocorrelation: It is a similarity between the observations as a function of the time lag between them. Autocorrelation tells us that where the data is stationary or not.

AIC (Akaike information criterion): These AIC values are used to choose the right p, I, and d values for us.

Abstract

In industry, the use of temperature sensors is paramount, with real-time sensors being crucial for temperature fluctuations. However, such sensing systems may fail due to environmental or technical factors such as corrosion, sensor body fault, or wire fault in the assembly line. Therefore, a reliable sensor on that infrastructure is required to complete the process efficiently. In this context, this paper introduces Data Prediction and Early Detection of Errors in Temperature Sensors (DPEDETS), a method which helps the digital monitoring of sensor health conditions of a temperature system for stool monitoring DPEDETS. The methodology involves the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) the mathematical concept test method to initiate a tentative assessment of sensory variation. Then, it detects and distinguishes confusion in the continuous transmission of sensory data, detecting premature sensory failure. The proposed DPEDETS method provides a reliable measurement of the time sensing data for the duration of sensing failure or temperature monitoring systems. The DPEDETS method has been tested on the temperature data collected from different types of temperature sensors. The results illustrate effectiveness of the DPEDETS process and sensory function of temperature monitoring on suites.


1) Block Representation of the Suggested DPEDETS System

2) Autocorrelation
 
Only stationary time series statistics are appropriate for the ARMA (p,q) model. However, the sensor statistics that the system is generating exhibits non-stationary behaviour. Letâ€™s see that with the help of the graphs of autocorrelation of non-stationary behaviour of our four temperature sensors. In the below figure graphs of 
autocorrelation of non-stationary behaviour of four temperature sensors are plotted. According to these graphs data which we have gathered from sensors show trend as it is increasing data.

3) Differencing
 
We need stationary data only so first we need to make it stationary and for this we have a method known as Difference. Below graph shows the difference in the data values which we obtained by shifting the values by one. Now it has become stationary

4) Checking Autocorrelation
 
Again check the autocorrelation of these graphs to see whether we are getting correct stationary or not. Below graphs shows the autocorrelation after applying the method of differencing and it is observed that graph is now symmetric along the both axes. Now we are ready to apply ARIMA model on our data.

8) Experimental Result Analysis
A predictive data frame that has been created can be transformed into a CSV file. With the aid of projected figures, we can determine what kind of inaccuracy took place. The red line in the following picture represents expected data, whereas the blue line represents sensory data. In Fig. 6.1 the first graph is a thermistor sensor data graph. We compare two data sets; suddenly there is a big difference between the two readings, which is why we conclude that 
there is a sensory error.

We compared two sets of data, there was a lot of difference between the two readings and the difference was even bigger, so we concluded that there was a sensor error. The third graph shown is the graphical database of the RTD PT100 sensor. We compared two data sets, and there is a lot of variation between the two curves, and the difference is also huge, which is why we conclude that there is a sensory error. The fourth graph is the graphical data graph of the LM35 shown. We compared two data sets, and there is a lot of variation between the two curves, and the difference is also huge, which is why we conclude that there is a sensory error.



9)  Conclusion
Introduces a method called DPEDETS, which detects premature neurological failure based on realtime exposure. Data were taken from industrial temperature sensors. The DPEDETS method uses the ARIMA model to evaluate sensory data to understand temporal adaptive capabilities. This assessment method is employed as a framework to offer an additional indicator of body sensitivity. Used as a reference to the DPEDETS method for misinterpreting expected data from the ARIMA model, early detection of sensory failure, and data retention. The DPEDETS method involves both predictive and diagnostic methods. In case of confusion, the algorithm separates the false data and finds the data number and related estimates. In addition, in the case of persistent error data, detection can be a very quick sensory failure and requested data retention process to provide predictable measures. Experimental tests indicate that the DPEDETS method can be used in industrial temperature monitoring systems 
with high accuracy and efficiency.
